<h4><center>A new modular typeface structured solely out 
  of triangles. The pattern consists of triangles joining at the baseline or flat edge of each shape forming the stems within a modular
structure. The inspiration for this design originated from a contrast of beliefs. 

A vast amount of influence from 
the Bauhaus movement following their idea of 
simplicity and that design should be used for 
purpose and the purpose alone, eliminating 
decorative factors and Wolf Wiegert,
 a particular piece displayed a pattern 
made up within the shape of a circle, which gave me the idea of creating one solid shape out of several small shapes. This typeface is a variation of triangles facing different sides creating diamonds and 
curves. It follows the Bauhaus belief 
“form follows function”.</center></h4>
