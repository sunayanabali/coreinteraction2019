	"There is also something funny about seriously discussing "I can has cheeseburger", one of the best known LOLcat memes."
	what does this show about our society values? how a mispelled sentence could become a huge joke.
	<br>
	Memes have given the world of humar a huge platform and have made taken over the internet.
	<br>
	will social media and the meme culture die down? will it ever stop or just increase?
	<br>
	i think this was an extremely interesting article as a meme could be one of the smartest ways of spreading and laying out a discussion on a large platform.
