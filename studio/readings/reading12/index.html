<center><p> 
In some designers’ eyes, form is seen as irrelevant as long as function, or in this case
content, is lacking in (the always subjective) value. </p>
<P>What Rock tries to argue is that form’s job is to manipulate, treat, and shape content to have meaning. Therefore as a designer, it is our job to create ways in which to make content meaningful,through form. </P>
<p>
<p> We seem to accept the fact that developing content is more essential than shaping it, that good content is the measure of good design.</p>

<p> Throughout this articles Rocks Main point is that the instead of a focus on “what,” designers need to emphasize the “how.” </p>
