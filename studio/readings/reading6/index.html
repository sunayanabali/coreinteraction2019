	<center><h2> Material Design </h2></center>

<center><p> The World Wide Web is a giant jungle. Everything is just a noise factor in an infinitesimal cosmos, just as is in the nature itself.
<br>
<br>
Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink.
<br>
<br>
All of these realms have their individually distinct design principles for their implementation that cannot even be interchanged in between. So how can you take it entirely and apply to an entirely different one?
<br> 
<br>
As Designers, we are always trying to find new ways  and create the unexpected, so when we are creating a UI, we need to consider the predictibilty and the interactions carefully.
<br>
<br>
Material Design reflects these qualities in how surfaces are displayed and move across the Material UI. Are the design formats completely seperate when designing for the phone or screen or are they adjusted? there's so many differences to take into account for while designing for primarily desktop vs mobile and high vs low frequency of usage.
<br>
<br>
We as designers should utilize every good aspect of Material Design but be careful with it at the same time. Are there ways to bypass some of these concerns discussed above and make the design better?
<br>
<br>
Material Design adopts Minimalism and make enough use of icons to replace text as much as possible. Designers have come up with solutions such as long press / tap to show the text of the icon. But isn't all this an unnecessary additional effort?
<br>
<br>
Any tool that creates something pleasant as well as eases the time and effort to create is going to gain traction. But how far will Material Design go in terms of making visual and verbal identities unique. Will too much of Material Design elements drive away customers?
