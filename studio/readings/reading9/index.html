	The Article argues whether design is something more than the form itself and the element of legibility.  its interesting to see the point of view where typography is intself a design which takes a particular form. the form is its own design. typography is a power tool itself that is a combination of letterforms that represent a language and can be used in different graphic forms. 
	However this makes us question, typography that is unintentially hard to read, is it still considered design due to their lack of communicating their message?
