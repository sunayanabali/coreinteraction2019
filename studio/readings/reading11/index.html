Its interesting to see how as designers and artists, we are looking for ways to being defined by the media we worked with. however we are constantly relying on this source to define ourselves with the use of these powertool tools. its like a driven force.<br>
Conditional design, used to avoid being defined by the media we work with and refer to our approach, the idea of switching the perspective of just focusing on the end product to focusing on the process of creation </p>

<p>Accoridng to Maurer, contemporary designers create tools that enable people to utilize design. Also, they make systems to engage "the intrinsic complexity of technology and life".</p>
