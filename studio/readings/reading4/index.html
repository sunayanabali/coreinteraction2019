	<center><h2> Research and Destroy: A Plea for Design as Research </h2></center>

<center><p> 
	We no longer have any desire for design that is driven by need. Something less prestigious than a ‘designed’ object can do the same thing for less money.
	<br>
	In the dramatic history of our world, money became not just generic objects of payment, but also symbols of societies. Combining utility and exclusivity, money is one of the challenging objects to design. And as with any complex task, currency design holds some valuable lessons for us, web designers. 
	<br>
	I think failure is important to succeed. As designers, our job is to fail multiple times only to create something successful. The world is our prototype and every day is a different version which often leads to more solutions to our ideas and creative process.
