This article helped open my eyes about te world of JavaScript. 
is code universally writen in english? or can it be transcribed for developer use?
The articles opens us to the declartive language of html and css and how  it describe a desired outcome without providing step-by-step intructions to the computer processing the file. however javascript isnt, and its important to provide precise instructions to the computer interpreting your code.
<br>
Can the Javascript language stand alone and replace all html and css language?
