"Rutherford Chang on the Art of Collection"
Rutherford Changs collections allowed him to study the finer details of the objects, in terms of its characteristics that set each of them apart from one another. Gathering his collection from different places, soures and people, he added onto his research. The social interactions that came with collecting guided him in curating what he wanted to collect.<br>

"Ordinary Plenty" â€“ Jeremy Keith"<br>

Jermy Keith talks about collecting as an act of holding onto things that are most important to us, He believes that we will never know what the value of these items wil be in the future. This almost implies that some objects may not have a life-time gaurantee of still existing in the later future, hence holding importance now than never. He also talks about his love for the world wide webs archive and talks about how it doesnt have a hierachy system of saving the important things and how it just saves everything, and can be filtered to its on choice and need.
