	<center><h2>What happens when you create a flexbox?</h2></center>
<center><p> 

The Flexbox Layout  aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.
The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height to fill the page. The automatic positioning for flex boxes is rows. Defining which arrangement you want can provide coders with variations of layouts that can be easily created.

<center><h2>What do we mean when we say responsive?</h2></center>
<center><p> 
	 When i think of the word responsive, i think of a user interactive tool, a site being capable of changing it's dimensions according to the screen size. Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
