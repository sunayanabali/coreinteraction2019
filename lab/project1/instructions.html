Objective of the Game: <br>
The objective of the game is to collect the most matching pairs. <br>
Steps: <br>
Pick a Set you want to play with <br>
Set 1: Find the Card name and Select it with its card<br>
Set 2: Match One card to Its Pair<br>
The player chooses two cards at a time that he would like to turn face up. He chooses these cards by clicking on them. If the images on the two cards match, they will face up as the game continues, otherwise they will be automatically turned face down. The player will continue to sequentially choose two cards until all cards will be matched. The strategy of the game is to try and remember where on the board the mismatched cards are placed and what do those cards display such that the player can subsequently improve his matching choices. The game ends and proceeds to the next level when all cards have been matched. <br> 
There are two levels for each set </p></center>
