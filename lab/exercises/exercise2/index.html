      <h2>Collection: Friedman-Abeles <br>
      Title: Abramson, Ruth.</h2>
      <center><img src="imgs/picture.jpg"width="200px"></center>
      <p>The collection contains work from the partnership of Leo and Sy Friedman and Joseph Abeles, together the pre-eminent firm documenting Broadway theater productions in the 1950s-1970s. The Friedman-Abeles Photographs consist primarily of photographs, negatives, contact sheets, proofs, slides, and oversized prints, spanning the partnership of Leo and Sy Friedman and Joseph Abeles. While the partnership lasted from 1954-1970, the collection does contain photographs from beyond this timeline. These photographs are generally marked as being from Talbot Studio or the Joseph Abeles Collection, the former being the studio Abeles founded before his partnership with the Friedmans, and the latter his studio afterwards. Almost all of the images are in black and white, but there is a series of color negatives, transparencies, and slides. Images from theatrical productions comprise the majority of the collection, and the images cover various stages of production. Many shows have rehearsal, production, and publicity prints. Some also have images of set construction, costume design, backstage visits, and parties. The images are from Broadway and off-Broadway shows, as well as out of town engagements throughout the northeast, and various other productions in Connecticut and New Jersey. There is also a series of the firm's other work that contains images from events around New York City- luncheons, award events, and other commercial work. The collection also contains studio portraits of actors, actresses, producers, authors, and others involved in theater. The invoices and correspondence series contains paperwork related to various projects, sales, reports, bills, and more. This correspondence is mostly from the late 1970s-early 1980s, and is specific to the Joseph Abeles Collection. A large section of this series is devoted to the 1980 Broadway Musical Calendar.</p>

      <h2>Collection: Billy Rose <br>
      Title: Ruth Huges Aarons </h2>
      <center><img src="imgs/picture3.jpg"width="400px"></center>
      <p>COLLECTION HISTORY:<br>
      The Billy Rose Theatre Collection's photograph archive holds personalities, productions, theatre buildings, and production studios. It is organized into three series, grouped by size of photographic print: "A" for the smallest, less than 8 x 10 inches; "B" for approximately 8 x 10 inches and slightly larger; and "C" for oversize prints. This digital presentation offers the complete contents of the so-called "A" files, which are rich in 19th-century carte-de-visite and cabinet card portraits, as well as 20th-century portrait proofs, personal snapshots, and photographic postcards. The series also includes some early production photographs, and a section on theatres subdivided geographically.<br>

      BACKGROUND<br>
      From its very beginning in 1931, the department has collected non-book materials, especially photographs and other visual documentation, from many sources. Today, the photo files remain a continuously expanding archive. Acquisitions stream in daily from various sources including press agents, publicists, personal collections or photos derived from archives and personal papers. In addition to the A-B-C archive are several large photograph holdings that are separately cataloged and housed; these include the Brugi√©re, Kesslere, Universal Pictures, Valente, and White collections, as well as the Vandamm collection (see also collection guide "Theatre Productions and Players, 1900-1957: Vandamm Studio Photographs").</p>
